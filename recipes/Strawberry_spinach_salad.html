    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> 
        This strawberry spinach salad is a great way to get kids to eat spinach! Someone brought this salad to a potluck dinner, 
        and I had to have the recipe. Since then, I've made it many times and I've been asked for the recipe every time I take it somewhere.
